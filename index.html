               Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015
			   was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 
			   11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised
			   in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace 
			   engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
			   science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and 
			   Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
			   Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
			   space programme and military missile development efforts.
